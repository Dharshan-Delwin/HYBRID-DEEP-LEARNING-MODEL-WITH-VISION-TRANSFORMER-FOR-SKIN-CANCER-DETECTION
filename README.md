Hybrid Deep Learning model with Vision Transformer for Skin Cancer Detection mainly deals with the Melanoma dataset which contains Benign and Malignant classes. 
It has achieved 92% accuracy in DenseNet121 and Vision Transformer (Self-Attention mechanim). Five models has been used for the skin cancer detection project. 
The models has achieved 91% accuracy in Gated Recurrent Unit, 88% accuracy in CNN,GRU & Vision Transformer with (Self-Attention mechanism). 
This models will be very useful in detecting the skin lesions.
